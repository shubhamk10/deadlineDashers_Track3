2) To run the server

```bash
cd G2_Backend
python app.py
```
Don't forget to add your own `.env` with **openai api key** and the **secret token** in the `backend` folder.

If the `server.py` runs fine then you should be able to see `Running on http://127.0.0.1:3000` in the terminal. 


### Now you can start using this extension !!!
